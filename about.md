When I read books or articles, my notes often take the form of a markdown file that I keep for future reference. I try to capture the essence of what I read in bullet points so that when I want to come back on a topic, reading my TL;DR would be enough in itself.

In this blog I will post some of those notes (albeit in a more presentable fashion), because I figured it might be useful to other people.

If you have any question or remark, feel free to contact me at laura.calem [at] protonmail.com.
