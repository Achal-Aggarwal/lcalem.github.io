Welcome to my new blogpost series! It's about an event I attended this summer in Lille, France: The SequeL Reinforcement Learning Summer School (RLSS)! I was lucky enough to be accepted there to learn and practice reinforcement learning concepts for two weeks. In this series of posts, you will be able to get a summarized version of what was taught, and hopefully learn something. These are also useful as general quick reminders of the basics of each topic.

Each day was separated between lectures, keynotes and practical sessions. The program can be found [here](https://rlss.inria.fr/program/), where you an also get access to the original material. On this page I'll put links to the various blogposts as I write them.
