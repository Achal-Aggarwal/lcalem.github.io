This series of posts intends to provide a TL;DR for every chapter of the 2nd edition of the book [_Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction_][sutton-book] by Sutton & Barto, published in 2018.

All the posts will follow the book's structure in bullet points, sometimes with additional explanations. It is intended for people having already read the book and needing a refresher, or for people familiar with the subject. It comes from a personal observation that sometimes, all we need to get back into a topic is to read the headlines of a chapter.

This post provides an entrypoint for all the per-chapter posts:

<h3>Tabular methods</h3>
[chapter 01 - introduction][sutton-chap01]<br/>
[chapter 02 - multi-armed bandits][sutton-chap02]<br/>
[chapter 02 - finite Markov decision processes][sutton-chap03]<br/>
